# Effective Stock Prediction Model
 Stock market prediction is the act of trying to determine the future value of company stock or other financial instruments traded on a financial exchange. The successful prediction of a stock's future price will maximize investor's gains. I have made a program (in 'R') with my own math logic function using a large data consisting of stocks and their changes through 4 years and the accuracy rate is 80-93% .
